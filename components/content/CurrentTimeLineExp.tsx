          As a mid-level full stack engineer at Poplar Homes, I've been pivotal
          in refining key aspects of our platform. I've focused on improving
          move-in and renewal processes, introducing multi-banking support in
          ownersâ€™ portal, and enhancing accounting with improved PayNow for
          one-time payments and AutoPay for scheduled transactions.
          Collaborating closely with product managers, project managers, UX
          writers, designers, QA engineers, data engineers, and devops, I've
          ensured seamless integration of these features. While not leading
          initiatives directly, my collaborative approach has played a crucial
          role in translating ideas into tangible improvements. Additionally,
          I've contributed to on-demand reports, providing valuable insights for
          informed decision-making. My role underscores a commitment to
          technical excellence and enhancing the user experience in critical
          areas of our Prop-tech platform.
